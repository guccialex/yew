# Futures Example

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/website?label=demo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexamples.yew.rs%2Fasync_reqwest)](https://examples.yew.rs/async_reqwest)

Fetches Yew's README file and renders it to the page. Similarly to the /futures example

## Concepts

Run async functions using ctx.link().send_future
Fetching requests with the Reqwest library on yew
An example of the simplest way to make requests with yew
Rendering HTML using gloo_utils

## Improvements

- It'd be nice if it could process json and show off more of how to use reqwest to do common fetching tasks but it's unclear where to find a json api that supports CORS
